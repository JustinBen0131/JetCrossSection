"""
Summary From Hanpus Slides:
1) The golden run list generation for now checks the Calo status, event numbers, gl1 mismatch and FEM mismatch to ensure the run is good.
2) The gl1 and FEM mismatch problem is supposed to be fixed by event combiner in the future (maybe now).
3) The Calo status also influenced by the gl1 and FEM mismatch, so in the future, we should have much more golden runs.
4) For now, there are some problems in the newest production ana430_2024p007. Before Run 48500, the production is not very good. And the output DST files are not always in the correct directory. CreateDstList cannot always give the right list.
5) The golden run is in /sphenix/user/hanpuj/CaloDataAna24/dst_list/data/runnumber.txt
The associated DST lists are in /sphenix/user/hanpuj/CaloDataAna24/dst_list/data/dst_list
